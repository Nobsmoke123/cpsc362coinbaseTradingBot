# cpsc362coinbaseTradingBot
Project for CPSC 362 - Foundations of Software Engineering.

We are creating a bitcoin trading bot that analyzes historical prices and suggests buy/sell sentiment. It will be a desktop application that utilizes the Coinbase API to execute GET/POST requests on historical data, which will then be analyzed to place buy or sell transactions. This bot will:
 
1. Link to your personal bitcoin account
2. View historical price data
3. View wallet contents (i.e. balance and history of transactions)
4. Buy/Sell window for placing a transaction; automatic trading?
 
Each objective above will include a back-end system that is linked to the front-end. Additionally, the bot will display transaction and wallet information through a terminal GUI. It will also have selectable menus/options to navigate through the software. The system will be constructed with the OOP methodology.)
